What is Fetch.ai, and what does it do?
Fetch.ai's vision is to create an AI-empowered platform that can connect services and APIs without any domain knowledge. 

Our technology is built on four key components: AI Agents, the Agentverse, the AI Engine, and the Fetch Network. AI Agents are independent decision-makers that connect to the network and represent data, APIs, services and people, while the Agentverse serves as a development platform for these agents. The AI Engine links human input to AI actions, and the Fetch Network underpins the entire system, ensuring smooth operation and integration.
