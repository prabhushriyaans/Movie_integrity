Authentication: To ensure security and restrict access to authorized users, the API might require authentication. This could be in the form of API keys, OAuth tokens, or other authentication mechanisms.

Response Format: The API will return data in a specific format, commonly JSON or XML. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is widely used due to its simplicity and readability.

Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, the API might impose rate limits, restricting the number of requests a user can make within a certain time frame.

Documentation: Good APIs come with comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the API, including details about endpoints, request and response formats, authentication, error handling, and examples.

Usage Examples: The documentation might also include usage examples in various programming languages to help developers understand how to integrate the API into their applications.
